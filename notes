problems:
first few days: lack of organization and understanding of how to approach idea

started to build things that we didn't use (showtimes, pick location)
struggled briefly with clearance, then did it ourselves

used pure just for buttons and form (probably not worth it)

broken gem


no testing: why?
we had a lot of features built very quickly
feature tests written early: just broke and were not considered important to fix
worked on front end first, build back end as needed, made it hard to write comprehensive tests
no one pushed for it, getting functional stuff built first felt like more of a priority
started from survey create page: considered it the centerpiece of the app, built it then decided what to do before and after it

team:
separated responsibilities according to who wanted to work on what
made merge conflicts relatively easy
all pretty chill people
standups daily and when necessary, let's just check in and regroup
bringing gary onboard, who hadn't worked on it before


what went well:
sticking to mvp, even though there were tons of features we wanted to add
doing styling for the first time
dividing up responsibilities into manageable chunks
