UX ideas
--------
* Start with one city, one theater for proof of concept
* RU starts by picking hour range (afternoon (12-5), evening, late night (after (9))
* Show showtimes within that range, in local city
* RU then selects by genre or language (selects what genres they're interested in), filter movies by that
* Embed trailer
* If implementing negative selection, animate deselecting movie
